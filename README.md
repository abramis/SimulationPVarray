Simulation of the operation of building-integrated photovoltaic arrays

For photovoltaic power generation plants, number of panels are interconnected in series and parallel to form a photovoltaic (PV) array. In this configuration, partial shade will result in decrease in power output and introduce multiple peaks in the P–V curve. As a consequence, the modules in the array will deliver different row currents. Therefore, to maximize the power extraction from PV array, the panels need to be reconfigured for row current difference minimization. Physical relocation based on PSO, GA and DE* connected modules are proposed. In these methods, the physical location of the modules remains unchanged, while its electrical connections are altered. Extensive simulations with different shade patterns are carried out and through analysis with the help of I–V, P–V curves is carried out to support the usefulness of the proposed methods.
